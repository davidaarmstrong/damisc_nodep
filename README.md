damisc
======

DAMisc is a package that I maintain to support my teaching at UWM and the ICPSR Summer Program.  Broadly speaking it contains a set of routines that aid in the interpretation and presentation of regression models (including linear models, GLMs and other limited dependent variables models).  I have tried not to duplicate functionality available elsewhere, rather to fill in with my own functions when other software proves inadequate or too cumbersome.   The package can be installed directly from this repository with: 

	library(devtools)
	install_github("damisc", username="davidaarmstrong")
